Our website is of different things that remind us of winter. There are activities to do outside, gift ideas, lights, examples of holiday cards, video games, and recipes. To navigate around the website you just click on the words inside of the box and it brings you to that category. If there is no home button and it is just an enlarged picture, then just click back in your browser. Most other pages should have a return home or return to their category button.

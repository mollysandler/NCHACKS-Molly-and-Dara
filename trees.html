<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>Preheat oven to 350ยบ and line two cookie sheets with parchment.</ol>
<ol>Cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Mix in egg and vanilla and almond extracts</ol>
<ol>In a separate bowl, whisk together dry ingredients. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and mix until smooth. Dough will be thick</ol>
<ol>Make three sizes of cookie dough balls: 1 teaspoon, 2 teaspoons, and 3 teaspoons. (You should have an even number of each)</ol>
<ol>Place medium and large cookies on a cookie sheet and press down slightly on each. Bake until center looks mostly cooked, 7 to 8 minutes</ol>
<ol>Place smallest balls of dough on another cookie sheet and press down slightly. Bake until center looks mostly cooked, 5 to 6 minutes</ol>
<ol>When cookies are done, remove from oven and let cool 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a cookie rack to finish cooling</ol>

<ol>Add remaining powdered sugar and mix until smooth</ol>
<ol>Add green gel icing color to frosting and mix until your desired shade of green</ol>
<ol>Assemble cookies: Get one size of each cookie. Fit a piping bag with a medium sized star piping tip (I used Wilton 32) and fill bag with green frosting</ol>
<ol>Pipe a swirl of frosting onto the largest cookie, then add the second medium sized cookie on top</ol>
<ol>Pipe a swirl of frosting onto the second cookie, then top with the smallest cookie</ol>
